my tcl stuff for AoC 2018-2021 - just fun

This are no good examples for tcl coding, not at all, please don't expect too much.

In case anybody reads this: My approach, my takeaway, is to keep the solutions as quick and dirty as possible. I do not want to create educational examples good for a tutorial.

Additionally this is vanilla tcl only. Don't want to get too fancy ;)

Thanks for reading!
